# Python-Codes-

#Hey, this is Madhav from 16th November 2023:
#I have been coding for a few years at this point but never knew I could post my code somewhere to reuse, display or share. 
#I will be uploading all the code I have accumuated for the past few years. (not the basic stuff ofc)
#I will try to solve and post at least one easy coding problem everyday and atleast a medium coding problem every week.
#I will do this until I stop practicing python and start learning other languages.
